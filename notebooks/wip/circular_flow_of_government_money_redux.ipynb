      "Previously, we have considered a number of successive spending rounds and calculated the total, cumulative income as a mathematical structure called a *geometric series*. That derivation is very mechanistic. It considers each and every successive spending round individually, which is good for building an intuitive understanding of what is happening, but is quite long winded. So here we'll develop a more succinct and elegant approach which is more conducive to inclusion in more complex models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recall that aggregate income represents the cumulative income of successive spending events via the circular flow of spending and incomes. Previously, we wrote this as:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} Y_{n} = Y_0 + Y_1 + Y_2 + Y_3 + ... $$\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we know that the initial income, $Y_0$ is due to government spending, $G$, and so we can rewrite this as:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} Y_{n} = G + Y_1 + Y_2 + Y_3 + ... $$\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, all of the remaining $Y_n$ terms represent the income arising from private sector - i.e. non-government - spending. So total income is made up of two quite distinct forms of spending: government spending and private spending, the private spending being a more complicated phenomena in that it involves the circular flow of repeatedly spending incomes. \n",
      "\n",
      "We can call this private sector spending *consumption* and denote it as $C_n$, i.e. we have repeated rounds of *consumption* - as distinct from government spending $G$:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} Y_{n} = G + C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + ... $$\n",
      "\n",
      "and writing this more succinctly, we can combine the consumption terms:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} Y_{n} = G + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n $$\n",
      "\n",
      "This equation simply states that total income is equal to government spending plus the cumulative total of subsequent private consumption spending. The term $\\sum C_n$ is called *final consumption* which attests to the fact that it represents the compounding of spending and incomes through a repeated, circular process, as opposed to the flow of a single spending event.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being even more neat and tidy we can drop the $\\sum$ notation and simply write:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$Y = G + C \\hspace{1cm} (1)$$\n",
      "\n",
      "where $Y$ is understood to represent total aggregate income and $C$ is understood to represent *final consumption*, i.e.:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$C = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n $$\n",
      "\n",
      "This is now closer to the income equation that is more commonly used in models of the economy. But it looks too simple doesn't it? How can it possibly include the compounding effects of consumption spending cycle that we understood via geometric series? The answer is that we simply need to combine it with one other equation that describes the spending behaviour of the private sector. Let's, for now, go for the non-saving behaviour:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$C = (1-\\theta)Y \\hspace{1cm} (2a)$$\n",
      "\n",
      "So we've defined final consumption as being equal to aggregate income after tax, that is all disposable income is spent with nothing saved. We now have two equations that describe our economy. Notice that there are *no* subscripts in these equations. They do not describe individual spending rounds. And they do not relate spending in one time period to income in an earlier one - they are *not* difference equations. Rather these are a pair of coupled equations, both referring to $C$ and $Y$ and therefore implying exact solutions for each. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we substitute $(2)$ in to $(1)$:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$Y = G + (1-\\theta)Y$$\n",
      "\n",
      "And solving for $Y$ gives:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$Y = \\frac {G}{(1 - (1-\\theta))}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "which simplifies to:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$Y = \\frac {G}{\\theta}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "This is same result we obtained using the geometric series approach: the values of $C$ and $Y$ which simultaneously satisfy equations 1 and 2 are the same as those that we rather mechanistically derived earlier when considering the sequence of repeated spending and taxation cycles that occurs following government spending. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we want to include saving then we simply define the appropriate consumption function:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$C = \\alpha(1-\\theta)Y \\hspace{1cm} (2b)$$\n",
      "\n",
      "and again, substituting $C$ into equation 1:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$Y = G + \\alpha(1-\\theta)Y$$\n",
      "\n",
      "and solving for $Y$:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$Y = \\frac {G}{1 - \\alpha(1-\\theta)}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, the same as we derived using the geometric series approach. When viewed separately, equations 1 and 2a/2b seem to state some rather trivial things about how spending relates to income. But taken together as a *system* of coupled equations they describe the full effects of the fiscal multiplier: the compounding of incomes and tax revenue through repeated but diminishing cycles of consumption spending. This is much more succinct and elegant than dealing with the geometric series equations, although geometric series approach perhaps does describe what's going on more intuitively.\n",
      "\n",
      "A further advantage of using this approach is that it completely dispenses with the concept of \"spending rounds\". There is a temptation (at least there was for me) when thinking along the lines of spending rounds to try to consider how long it takes for a single spending round to occur or the number of rounds to be considered. It seems reasonable, for example, that the number of spending rounds included in any analysis would depend on the time period under consideration. This is quite an unecessary and misguided line of thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is misguided because, while being quite an intuitive way of thinking about sequences of spending, \"spending rounds\" do not really reflect how a modern, complex economy operates. In real economies collective spending does not precede collective income in discrete, ordered stages. Spending and the receipt of incomes arise via an incredibly complex network of millions of overlapping transactions occuring continuously.   \n",
      "\n",
      "It is unecessary because we can completely describe any scenario we want without stipulating anything about the number or frequency of spending events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, since income is a flow, when we track it we are implicitly considering a particular time period. Irrespective of how fast the money circulates or how quickly each spending round proceeds\n"
